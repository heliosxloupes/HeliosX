Question,Explanation
"🟦 Q1 — Burns & Contracture Reconstruction (2025)<br><br><b>What reconstructive method has the lowest recurrence rate for a large cervical burn contracture when adjacent skin is limited?</b>","<b>A fasciocutaneous free flap</b><br><br>- Best option for large cervical contractures with limited adjacent normal skin<br>- Lowest recurrence, single-stage<br>- STSG: high recurrence<br>- FTSG: lower recurrence than STSG but not appropriate for large areas<br>- Dermal substitutes: require staged thin STSG and still have higher contracture rates than flaps"
"🟦 Q2 — Tufted Angioma (2025)<br><br><b>How does tufted angioma typically present in children, and what is the preferred management for an uncomplicated lesion?</b>","- Vascular tumor in first 5 years of life<br>- Firm, painful red/violaceous plaques on head, neck, trunk<br>- Often associated with overlying hyperhidrosis (eccrine gland hypertrophy)<br>- Histology: ""cannonball"" tufts of capillaries in dermis/subcutis; D2-40 and PROX1 positive, GLUT1 negative<br><br><b>Management</b><br>- Small, uncomplicated trunk lesion → excision<br>- Large uncomplicated/symptomatic lesions → low-dose aspirin<br>- Kasabach-Merritt or complicated cases → oral corticosteroids → vincristine / interferon / sirolimus ± PDL / embolization"
"🟦 Q3 — Intercostobrachial Nerve Anatomy (2025)<br><br><b>What is the course, sensory territory, and clinical relevance of the intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN)?</b>","- ICBN = lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve (T2)<br>- Exits chest wall at 2nd intercostal space, midaxillary line → crosses axilla → medial arm<br>- Sensory to axilla, medial upper arm, lateral chest<br>- Often injured during axillary lymph node dissection → numbness, dysesthesia, postmastectomy pain<br>- Anatomic variation: connections to medial cord or medial brachial cutaneous nerve in ~41% of patients → explains variable symptoms"
"🟦 Q4 — NPWT as a Skin Graft Bolster (2025)<br><br><b>What is the effect of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on split-thickness skin grafts when used as a bolster?</b>","- Increases overall survival of split-thickness skin grafts<br>- Especially beneficial in high-mobility areas (e.g., around joints)<br>- Foam + suction improve contact between graft and wound surface<br>- Suction decreases shear forces during movement<br>- Randomized trials show improved take without increased infection, hematoma, or pain<br>- Length of stay similar or shorter compared with traditional bolsters"
"🟦 Q5 — Infantile Hemangioma (2025)<br><br><b>What is the first-line medical treatment for infantile hemangioma on the nasal dorsum, and why is it preferred?</b>","- Infantile hemangiomas = most common benign solid tumor of infancy (4–5% of infants)<br>- Nasal dorsum lesions risk visual obstruction → amblyopia<br><br><b>First-line treatment</b><br>- Oral propranolol for at least 6 months<br>- More effective and better tolerated than oral corticosteroids<br>- FDA approved for infants >5 weeks and >4.5 lb (2 kg)<br>- Can be managed outpatient in stable infants >8 weeks with monitoring (glucose, cardiac status)<br><br><b>Other options</b><br>- Topical timolol: less effective than oral propranolol<br>- Intralesional steroids: poorly tolerated, risk atrophy, hypopigmentation, ulceration<br>- Bleomycin injections no longer used (ulceration + soft-tissue atrophy, superior alternatives exist)"
"🟦 Q6 — Monofilament vs Multifilament Sutures (2025)<br><br><b>How do monofilament and multifilament sutures compare in terms of infection risk, handling, and tensile properties?</b>","- Multifilament sutures have greater surface area → can harbor bacteria and prolong infection in contaminated wounds<br>- Monofilament sutures: less pliable, lower knot security → need more throws<br>- Multifilament sutures: more pliable → better knot security<br>- Monofilament sutures of similar size/composition: less tensile strength than multifilament<br>- Despite these differences, monofilament sutures do NOT increase risk of wound dehiscence compared to multifilament"
"🟦 Q7 — Upper Back Reconstruction (2025)<br><br><b>What flaps are useful for posterior upper trunk defects, and what artery supplies the parascapular flap?</b>","- Posterior upper trunk defects often reconstructed with local/regional flaps due to limited recipient vessels for free flaps<br>- Latissimus and trapezius flaps: options but require muscle harvest and have seroma risk<br>- Perforator options: circumflex scapular artery perforator flap, thoracodorsal artery perforator flap<br>- Parascapular flap: highly useful for upper back, upper extremity, and shoulder defects<br><br><b>Vascular supply</b><br>- Parascapular flap is based on the circumflex scapular artery<br>- Circumflex scapular artery branches from subscapular artery and passes through the triangular space (teres minor, teres major, long head of triceps; does NOT include latissimus dorsi or infraspinatus)"
"🟦 Q8 — Friction Blisters (2025)<br><br><b>Where do friction blisters form in the epidermis, and what is the recommended management?</b>","- Occur after repetitive mechanical trauma, especially on palms and soles<br>- Separation occurs within the epidermal stratum spinosum<br>- Blister fluid = sterile serum with few inflammatory cells (unless secondarily infected)<br><br><b>Management</b><br>- Initial treatment of sterile blisters: observation<br>- Larger painful blisters may be drained for relief, but unroofing is generally not recommended (higher infection risk)<br>- Unroofing/excision + skin grafting is not indicated for simple friction blisters<br>- Sterile blisters heal by secondary intention and re-epithelialize<br>- Secondarily infected blisters → incision and drainage + local wound care"
"🟦 Q9 — Trapezius Flap Vascular Supply (2025)<br><br><b>What is the primary blood supply to the pedicled trapezius flap and what regions can it reconstruct?</b>","- Pedicled myocutaneous trapezius flap = workhorse for cervicothoracic back, neck, posterior scalp; can reach head and neck anteriorly<br>- Primary blood supply from the transverse cervical artery (TCA), which arises from the thyrocervical trunk<br>- Superficial branch of TCA → superior trapezius and overlying skin<br>- Deep branch (dorsal scapular artery) → inferior trapezius<br><br><b>Other pedicles to know</b><br>- Scapular flap → circumflex scapular artery<br>- Latissimus dorsi / serratus anterior flaps → thoracodorsal artery<br>- Paraspinous muscles → perforators from vertebral and intercostal arteries"
"🟦 Q10 — Female Androgenetic Alopecia (2025)<br><br><b>How does female androgenetic alopecia typically present, and what is the recommended first-line therapy?</b>","- Common cause of nonscarring alopecia in women; onset any time after puberty, often around menopause<br>- Clinical picture: diffuse thinning over central scalp with preservation of frontal hairline (unlike males)<br>- Only ~1/3 have abnormal androgen levels; evaluate for hyperandrogenic conditions (PCOS, hyperprolactinemia, adrenal hyperplasia, tumors) when indicated<br>- Dermoscopy: hair miniaturization; biopsy useful to exclude cicatricial alopecia / alopecia areata<br><br><b>Treatment</b><br>- First-line: topical minoxidil<br>- Oral anti-androgens may be added in selected patients<br>- Low-level laser (light) therapy and microneedling are secondary options<br>- Hair transplantation considered in advanced disease<br>- Finasteride is NOT FDA-approved for women with female androgenetic alopecia (off-label only)"
